about_content: |
  I am a Chinese-Canadian writer and policy analyst currently based in Palo Alto, California. Currently, I'm finishing my Master's degree at Stanford.
  I'm interested in technology, politics, and culture, with a broad focus on the contemporary Sinophone world. I currently write about Chinese AI for [ChinaTalk](https://substack.com/@irenezhang). I've previously worked at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
